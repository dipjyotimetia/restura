# Extension Release Runbook

How to ship the two browser/editor extensions that live in `extension/`:

- **VS Code** — `extension/vscode` (`restura-vscode`) → VS Code Marketplace + Open VSX.
- **Chrome** — `extension/chrome` (Restura Capture, `@restura/extension`) → Chrome Web Store.

The extensions version and ship **independently of the desktop app**. The main
[`release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs `npm version --workspaces`
but only commits the root + CLI `package.json`, so the extension manifests stay
pinned in git and are released on their own cadence by the two workflows below.

| Extension | Workflow                                         | Tag pattern     | Authoritative version file              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| VS Code   | `.github/workflows/extension-vscode-release.yml` | `vscode-v*.*.*` | `extension/vscode/package.json`         |
| Chrome    | `.github/workflows/extension-chrome-release.yml` | `chrome-v*.*.*` | `extension/chrome/public/manifest.json` |

> **Why two version files?** The Chrome Web Store reads the version from the
> built `manifest.json` (not `package.json`), so the Chrome workflow validates
> the tag against `manifest.json`. The VS Code Marketplace reads `package.json`.
> Each workflow fails fast if the tag's version doesn't match its authoritative
> file — so a forgotten bump can't silently ship the wrong version.

## One-time maintainer setup

### Secrets

Set these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. Every publish step
**self-skips when its secrets are absent** — the workflow still builds, packages,
and attaches the artifact to a GitHub release, so it is safe to run before any
secrets exist.

| Secret                 | Required for                | Notes                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VSCE_PAT`             | VS Code Marketplace publish | Azure DevOps PAT with Marketplace **Manage** scope. See the vsce publishing docs. |
| `OVSX_PAT`             | Open VSX publish (optional) | Open VSX access token. The Open VSX step self-skips if unset.                     |
| `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`  | Chrome Web Store publish    | The published item's ID.                                                          |
| `CHROME_CLIENT_ID`     | Chrome Web Store publish    | OAuth2 client ID for the Web Store API.                                           |
| `CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET` | Chrome Web Store publish    | OAuth2 client secret.                                                             |
| `CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Chrome Web Store publish    | OAuth2 refresh token authorising publish.                                         |

### Publisher accounts (first release only)

- **VS Code Marketplace** — the `dipjyotimetia` publisher must exist (create it
  in the [Marketplace management portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)).
- **Open VSX** — the `dipjyotimetia` **namespace** must exist on
  [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org) before the first `ovsx publish`, or it
  fails with a namespace error. Create it once with `npx ovsx create-namespace dipjyotimetia -p $OVSX_PAT`.
- **Chrome Web Store** — the extension must already be created (a first manual
  upload) so it has an ID to put in `CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`.

## Releasing the VS Code extension

1. Bump the version in `extension/vscode/package.json` in a normal PR and merge to `main`.
2. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag vscode-v1.2.3
   git push origin vscode-v1.2.3
   ```
3. The workflow runs: type-check → unit tests → `vsce package` → publish to
   Marketplace + Open VSX → create a GitHub release with the `.vsix` attached.
4. Verify on the [Marketplace listing](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dipjyotimetia.restura-vscode)
   (publishing can take a few minutes to index).

The tag's `1.2.3` **must** equal `package.json`'s `version` or the run fails.

---

## Releasing the Chrome extension

1. Bump `"version"` in `extension/chrome/public/manifest.json` in a normal PR and merge to `main`.
2. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:
   ```bash
   git tag chrome-v1.2.3
   git push origin chrome-v1.2.3
   ```
3. The workflow runs: type-check → build MV3 bundle → validate manifest version
   → zip → upload to the Chrome Web Store (submitted for review) → create a
   GitHub release with the `.zip` attached.
4. Web Store submissions go through Google's review queue (minutes to days). The
   GitHub release + zip are available immediately for manual/unpacked install.

The tag's `1.2.3` **must** equal `manifest.json`'s `version` or the run fails.

---

## Dry runs (test without publishing)

Both workflows expose a manual `dry_run` (default **true**) that builds and
packages the artifact and uploads it as a workflow **build artifact**, but never
publishes to a store and never creates a GitHub release. Use it to smoke-test the
pipeline before configuring secrets, or to grab a `.vsix` / `.zip` for local testing.

```bash
gh workflow run extension-vscode-release.yml --ref main   # dry_run defaults to true
gh workflow run extension-chrome-release.yml --ref main
```

Or **Actions → "Release — VS Code extension" / "Release — Chrome extension" →
Run workflow**. Download the artifact from the run summary:

- VS Code: `code --install-extension restura-vscode-<version>.vsix`
- Chrome: extract the zip, then **chrome://extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked**.

> A real publish happens **only** on a `*-v*.*.*` tag push. A `workflow_dispatch`
> run can never publish, even with `dry_run` unticked.

---

## Recovery after a failed run

Unlike the desktop release, these workflows never commit back to `main` and the
tag is what you pushed — so recovery is just deleting the GitHub release/tag and
retrying:

```bash
# Drop the GitHub release + its tag, fix the version, then re-tag.
gh release delete vscode-v1.2.3 --cleanup-tag --yes   # or chrome-v1.2.3
git push origin :refs/tags/vscode-v1.2.3              # if the tag wasn't cleaned up
```

Common failures:

- **`Tag … does not match … version`** — you tagged before bumping the
  authoritative version file. Bump it (or retag at the correct commit) and retry.
- **Marketplace/Web Store publish error** — the build + GitHub release already
  succeeded; the artifact is attached to the release. Fix the credential/listing
  issue and re-run only the publish manually (`vsce publish --packagePath …` /
  `chrome-webstore-upload --source …`) using the attached artifact, rather than
  re-cutting the whole release.
- **Web Store "version already exists"** — that version was already uploaded;
  bump and re-tag.
